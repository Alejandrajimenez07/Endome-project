## UX


### Colour Scheme

The colours used in this project are base on the logo, which I made myself taking inspiration on a uterus image that is attached on the logo.

- `B65952` used for the header, nav bar and footer.
- `#C66963` used for main containers.
- `#E9E0E1` used for body background.
- `#362625` used for all text in the website.
- `#E6CACA` used for get in touch container's background.




Example:

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/user/palettes/646a10d8da6879000b379175) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography 

#### Fonts

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for all text on the website, it is a popular font for web design as it has high readability for the user.

## Wireframes

I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

    - The navigation bar also has a hover with the same background as the header.
    - I added space lettering to both header and nav bar to make it easier to read.

   - When the screens is smaller than 640px 'home' page does not display this is with the purpose of having a more clean nav bar on smallers screens.

- **About Endome and Endometriosis session:**


  - The section contains two header and two paragraphs.
  - What is Endome section explains what is endome's organisation and what is the purpose of the website.
  - What is Endometriosis section contains information explaining what the disease consist of and it gives clear information to the user that wants to know more about it.

- **Stages section:**
  - This section containes information about the different stages of Endometriosis helping the user to identify the stage they might be on.
  - Each stage container contains a link where they can have more information with detailed explanation of each stage. The website can be found [here](https://www.endofound.org/stages-of-endometriosis).
![screenshot](documentation/img/features/stages-section.png)
- **Footer:**
  -The footer is located at the bottom of all three pages and it has the same background color as the header, that gives consistency on the design.
  -Footer contains the 'endome copyright 2023' and icons with social media links that will take you to external link. (Social media link does not diverts the users to real social media accounts).
  ![screenshot](documentation/img/features/footer.png)

- **Symptoms page:**
  - At Symptoms page you will find three headers each one with one paragraph briefing each section and a list underneath.
  - On symptoms section you can have information regarding endometriosis's symptoms, it gives a little brief about each symptom and how it can affect on daily life. I have also created 3 containers with different background to keep the consistency of the design and also make it easy to identify each list.
  - Symptoms brief paragraph contains a [link](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometriosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354656) where the user can find more details information about each symtom and more.
  ![screenshot](documentation/img/features/symptoms%20section%20.png)
- **Treatments section**
  - The second section follows the same scheme. First a brief explanation, followed by a list.
   - The list the different treatment that people can get to try and easy the condition.
   - Within the brief paragraph you will also found a [link](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/endometriosis/) with more detail information about each treatment.
- **Tips section:**
  - Tips is aligned with treatments section, I strongly believe that looks better in a row instead of columns as the information of treatment is also related to tips.
  - The tips's list contains some tips that the user will benefit from as this will help to ease the condition...
  - The paragraph also contains a external [link](https://www.healthline.com/health/endometriosis/living-with-endometriosis) with more useful tips for the user.
![screenshot](documentation/img/features/treatments-tips-section.png)

   - Get in touch contains a header with a paragraph inviting the user to fill up our contact page.
   ![screenshot](documentation/img/features/getintouch-section.png)
   - **Contact form:** Here you will find a contact form to fill up, first and last name are not required  but email is.
   - It also has two check box for the user to subscribe and also request to be contacted.
   - It has a 'Submit' button that is clickeable and it takes you to our 'thank you page'.
   ![screenshot](documentation/img/features/contact-form.png)
   - **Contact hero image:** I also added an image that gives freedom and relief vibes, this will make the user feel that they can trust us and this website is a place where they can feel secure and more confident with the information provided.
   - The image also flows with the colors palette scheme and I think it blends with the desire design.

  - Thank you page is the page where the user will be taking once the submit the form.
  - The style of the page is very simple. It contains the main header and a little text, wrapped in a pale pink container.

## Credits

I have faced many challenges with this project, particuraly as I was affected on my ability to learn and focus due some personal issues I had while I was doing the course. 

I want to thank to Iris_ci Cohort Facilitator and Student Care from Code Institute for supporting me through the journey by giving me advise and specially encouring me to continue with this journey.


As start I have took inspiration from 'Love running project' for the header, nav bar and footer.

**For further HTML and CSS issues I encountered these sites have been used for reference:**
  - I played this [game](flexboxfroggy.com) to help to understand how to flex box works.
  - I have also watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXIhdp5R7sc) and this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18VLSXfsj94&t=915s) to help to understand more and also choose if i wanted to use grid or flex box. Which the first video was sent by Martina and the second I did found it myself in youtube.
  - I have research on [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/sel_hover.php) to remind how to apply hover effect
  - I have visit this [website](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/flexbox-vs-css-grid-which-should-you-use--cms-30184) to learn more about layouts.
  - I have also watched several videos from this [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH9xx-RRVNG187ETT2ekWFsq) chanel called 'Web Dev simplified' it has a lot of videos that helps to understand better web development for beginners and to find potencial solutions in any issue I faced. (I have attached the link for the list of videos I have watched).
  - I have also used this two Readme files https://github.com/CarinaAJ/p1-aurora-borealis/blob/main/README.md#credits and https://github.com/CluelessBiker/project1-la-lucha/blob/main/README.md#features that was send by Martina to help me to understand how to make it and also use it as a guide/inspiration to write this document.
  - I borrowed the folloring code from W3school for the contact [form](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_input_type_submit) and have also borrow another peace of [code](https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css3_buttons.asp) to style the 'submit' button.
