            <p>
                Welcome to Endome!
                Endome is a non-profit organization that has been founded by a woman who has had to learn to live with a disease called "Endometriosis". </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this blog is to inform and help women who suffer from this condition and/or family and friends who have people who are going through this situation. 
                Here you will find useful information that can help you to understand more your new or existing disease and learn to improve symptoms.

            <h2>What is Endometriosis?</h2>
            <p>
                Endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which tissue similar to the tissue that normally lines the inside of your uterus — the endometrium — grows outside your uterus. 
                Endometriosis most commonly involves your ovaries, fallopian tubes and the tissue lining your pelvis. 
                Rarely, endometrial-like tissue may be found beyond the area where pelvic organs are located.
            </p>
                <p> 
                    With endometriosis, the endometrial-like tissue acts as endometrial tissue would — it thickens, breaks down and bleeds with each menstrual cycle. 
                    But because this tissue has no way to exit your body, it becomes trapped. When endometriosis involves the ovaries, cysts called endometriomas may form. 
                    Surrounding tissue can become irritated, eventually developing scar tissue and adhesions — bands of fibrous tissue that can cause pelvic tissues and organs to stick to each other.
